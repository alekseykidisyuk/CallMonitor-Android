/**
 * The same recording transcribed twice — whole-file, then in chunks — so the two can be read against
 * each other.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Chunked transcription was written, unit-tested, shipped, and made real
 * transcripts worse: lines that did not match the audio, and repeated lines. It was reverted the same
 * day. The ten unit tests behind it all passed, because they tested the *planning arithmetic* — which
 * was never where the risk was. The risk was in the audio, and nothing touched audio until a person
 * listened to a real call.
 *
 * So the chunked path lives **here**, not in [TranscriptionEngine], until this benchmark says it is
 * safe. Production still transcribes whole files.
 *
 *     adb shell am instrument -w \
 *       -e class com.baba.callvault.transcription.ChunkSeamBenchmark \
 *       -e recording /sdcard/Download/cv-bench.ogg \
 *       com.baba.callvault.instrtest.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
 *
 * Use a recording **longer than [ChunkPlan.TARGET_CHUNK_MS]**, or there is only one chunk and no seam
 * to examine. Read [DecodeVariantBenchmark]'s KDoc first: the same ColorOS foreground-window trap
 * applies, and a wall-clock measured across a freeze is worthless.
 *
 * ## What this is actually for
 *
 * Not a score — a **discriminator**. Four hypotheses survived the revert and each predicts a different
 * signature, so the report below is built to tell them apart rather than to say "worse":
 *
 *  1. **Seek reports a rebased timestamp.** The design stitches from where the decoder says its audio
 *     really began. If that comes back at or near 0 for every chunk, every timestamp after the first is
 *     wrong. → the `decoded from` column shows it outright, and needs no transcript reading at all.
 *  2. **Codec priming after a seek.** Opus pre-skip and AAC priming are emitted after a seek and are
 *     not real audio. → `decoded from` sits slightly *before* the request, consistently, by tens of ms.
 *  3. **Cold starts hallucinate.** Every chunk begins with no conditioning on a 10 s run-up, which is
 *     exactly when whisper loops. → repetition clusters at the *start* of chunks 2+, and the duplicated
 *     text sits just after a seam rather than anywhere.
 *  4. **The seams simply cost more than predicted.** → no timing anomaly, no clustering, just worse
 *     text everywhere in the chunked run.
 *
 * Hypotheses 1 and 2 are settled by the header alone. 3 and 4 need the transcripts read side by side,
 * which is why both are written out in full.
