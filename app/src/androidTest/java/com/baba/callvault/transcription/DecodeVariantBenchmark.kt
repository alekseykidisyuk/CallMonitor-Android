/**
 * The same real call, transcribed once per [DecodeSettings] variant, so each knob can be judged on
 * its own output rather than on a citation.
 *
 * There is no WER here and there is not going to be one without a reference transcript, so the
 * evidence this produces is the **text itself**: every variant's transcript is written out in full,
 * next to its wall-clock and segment count, for a human to read side by side. A number that does not
 * come with the words it scored cannot distinguish "fewer segments" from "lost half the call".
 *
 * Variants are named on the command line so a run can be cut short — a full sweep is four passes
 * over the same audio, which on the OP9 Pro is the better part of an hour.
 *
 *     adb shell am instrument -w \
 *       -e class com.baba.callvault.transcription.DecodeVariantBenchmark \
 *       -e recording /sdcard/Download/cv-bench.ogg \
 *       -e variants baseline,vad,vad_beam,vad_beam_ctx0 \
 *       com.baba.callvault.instrtest.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
 *
 * The recording is named rather than discovered, for the same reason [com.baba.callvault.summary]'s
 * benchmark names it: which of someone's calls gets processed is their choice. The transcripts are a
 * real conversation and stay on the device.
 *
 * **ColorOS freezes an instrumented run whose app has no foreground window.** Launch MainActivity
 * right after `am instrument` or this stalls in a way that looks exactly like a native deadlock —
 * the process stays alive at its full RSS with `utime` frozen, which reads as a hang in whisper. It
 * is not enough to launch it once: the shade sliding down over the activity re-freezes it, so a run
 * this long needs `svc power stayon true` and something that re-foregrounds the activity if focus
 * moves. A wall-clock measured across a freeze is worthless; the first run of this benchmark
 * reported 743 s for a 350 s decode.
 *
 * MEASURED, OP9 Pro (LE2121), `large-v3-turbo-q8_0`, a real 4:05 Hebrew business call, `lang=he`:
 *
 * | variant | wall | segments | chars |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `baseline`       | 362 s | 54 | 2645 |
 * | `vad`            | 341 s | 47 | 2706 |
 * | `vad_beam`       | 358 s | 47 | **2749** |
 * | `vad_beam_ctx64` | **310 s** | 42 | 2662 |
 * | `vad_beam_ctx0`  | 332 s | **79** | 2475 |
 *
 * The headline is the first and third rows: **what ships is 358 s against the old 362 s.** VAD
 * removes more audio than beam search adds work, so the two changes together are free — the speed
 * question that was supposed to gate beam search turned out not to have a cost to weigh.
 *
 * Read the transcripts, not the table: `vad_beam_ctx0`'s 79 segments are the same words cut into
 * one-to-two-second pieces, and its 2475 characters are the same call with content missing. The
 * per-field KDoc on [DecodeSettings] quotes the specific lines each variant gained and lost.
