/**
 * Exercises the whisper.cpp JNI bridge on a real device.
 *
 * These cannot be JVM unit tests: the bridge is a native library, and its two most dangerous failure
 * modes are invisible to the compiler. A mismatched JNI symbol name only fails when the method is
 * first called, and a wrong language parameter does not fail at all — it produces fluent, confident
 * nonsense in the wrong script.
 *
 * The transcription test needs two fixtures, which are **not** committed (a model is hundreds of
 * megabytes, and real call audio must never enter a public repo). Push them first:
 *
 * ```
 * D=/sdcard/Android/data/com.baba.callvault/files
 * adb push ggml-small-q5_1.bin $D/cv-test-model.bin
 * adb push some-hebrew-call.ogg $D/cv-test-audio.ogg
 * ```
 *
 * Without them the transcription test skips rather than fails, so a normal `connectedAndroidTest`
 * run stays green on a machine that has not staged fixtures.
