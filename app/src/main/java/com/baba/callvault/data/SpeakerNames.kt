/**
 * Puts names to the channels a transcript was labelled with.
 *
 * **This is the whole reason segments store `A` and `B` rather than names.** Which captured channel
 * carries the far party is an OEM detail the app learns from ringback over several calls, so the
 * answer can arrive long after a transcript was written — and can be *lost* again if the calls that
 * taught it are deleted. Resolving here, on every read, means a mapping learned tomorrow improves
 * every transcript already on the phone, and a mapping lost falls back to neutral labels instead of
 * leaving a name that is now a guess.
 *
 * @param map     the trusted mapping, or [ChannelMap.UNKNOWN] to stay neutral.
 * @param you     what to call the phone's owner.
 * @param contact who the call was with — the same name the transcript is titled with.
 * @param sideA   the neutral label for channel A, used while the mapping is unknown.
 * @param sideB   the neutral label for channel B.
