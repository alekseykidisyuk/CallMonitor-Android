     * `sizeBytes > 0` was the entire test, and it let seven files of **exactly 98 bytes** through as
     * successful recordings on the maintainer's phone in August 2026 — a bare header with no audio
     * samples. Reporting success there is worse than reporting nothing: the user only finds out when
     * they go looking for a call that mattered, and the research pass of 2026-08-27 found ~86 accounts
     * of exactly that, including court evidence and medical calls.
     *
     * 1 KiB is chosen to sit *below* the smallest real recording rather than near the failures: one
     * second at 8 kbps, the lowest bitrate CallVault offers, is about 1000 bytes of audio before the
     * container is counted. A sub-second call could in principle land under it, but such a file holds
     * nothing usable either, so the label is still honest.
     *
     * This catches a file with no samples. It does **not** catch a full-length file of silence — that
     * needs a PCM peak check on the capture path, which is the same follow-on that would let carrier
     * capture answer `farPartyHeard` instead of passing null.
