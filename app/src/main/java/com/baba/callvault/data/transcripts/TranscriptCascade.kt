 * Transcripts live in their own database ([TranscriptDatabase]) because the recordings catalog is a
 * destructible cache, which means a cross-database `ON DELETE CASCADE` is not available. This object
 * *is* the cascade, and it is called from [com.baba.callvault.data.recordings.RecordingCatalog] at
 * every point a catalog row is dropped.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is a privacy defect rather than an untidiness: the app would report a recording
 * as deleted while keeping a searchable transcript of the conversation, which is more exposing than

     * no-op before the first transcription, so deleting a recording on a device that has never used
     * the feature does not create a database.
