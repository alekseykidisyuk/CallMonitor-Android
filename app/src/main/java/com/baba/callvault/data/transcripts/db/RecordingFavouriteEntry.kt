/**
 * One starred recording, keyed by the same [displayName] natural key the rest of the app uses.
 *
 * Presence is the whole state — a row means starred, no row means not — so there is no boolean column
 * to fall out of step with itself. It lives here beside `recording_tags` rather than in the recordings
 * catalog because it is the user's own judgement about a call, not a fact about the file, and it must
 * survive the catalog being rebuilt from a folder scan.
 *
 * A star is NOT a tag, despite the similar shape. Tags are renameable and deletable by the user, and a
 * star that could be renamed out of existence would silently withdraw the protection below.
 *
 * **This table is load-bearing for data safety.** A starred recording is exempt from every automatic
 * delete — the retention sweep and the storage cap both skip it — so a bug that loses a row here does
 * not merely lose a star, it re-exposes the one recording the user said to keep.
