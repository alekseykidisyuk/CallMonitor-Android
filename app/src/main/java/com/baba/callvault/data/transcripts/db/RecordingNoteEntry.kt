 * What the user wrote about a call, in their own words.

 * Not a transcript, which is why it exists alongside one: a transcript records what was said, a note
 * records what it meant — the price agreed, the thing to chase, the reason to ring back.
 *
 * It lives in this database and **not** in the recordings catalog for a reason that matters more here
 * than it does for transcripts: the catalog is a rebuildable cache with a destructive fallback, and a
 * transcript can at least be regenerated from the audio at the cost of CPU. A note cannot be
 * regenerated from anything. Losing one loses it for good.
