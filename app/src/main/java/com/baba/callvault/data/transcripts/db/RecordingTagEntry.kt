/**
 * One label the user has put on one recording.
 *
 * **In the transcripts database, not the recordings catalog**, for the same reason notes are: the
 * catalog has a destructive fallback because it can be rebuilt from the storage folders, and a tag
 * cannot be rebuilt from anything. It is a judgement the user made — *this call was about the flat* —
 * and nothing on disk records it.
 *
 * **Keyed by `displayName` and the tag together**, so applying a tag twice is a no-op rather than a
 * duplicate row, and so removing one is a delete rather than a search. The index on `tag` is what
 * makes filtering the list by a tag cheap once someone has years of calls.
 *
 * The best evidence for this feature is a request that also explains it: contacts are not enough,
 * because a great many calls are with numbers that are not in anybody's address book.
