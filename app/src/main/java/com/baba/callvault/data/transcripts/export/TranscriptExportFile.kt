 * Writes an export to a file the share-sheet can attach.
 *
 * **In `cacheDir`, deliberately.** An exported transcript is a copy made to hand somewhere else, not
 * a second place the app keeps the user's data: the original stays in the database. Putting it in the
 * cache means the system can reclaim it, and means a transcript never accumulates silently in private
 * storage where a file manager cannot reach it and the user cannot know it is there.
 *
 * The folder is emptied before each export rather than after: a share is asynchronous and the
 * receiving app may still be reading the file when the chooser closes, so deleting it on the way out
 * is a race. Clearing on the way *in* keeps exactly one export on disk and cannot delete a file
 * something is currently reading.
