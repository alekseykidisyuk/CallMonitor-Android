/**
 * CallVault Plan 5, Tasks 1–2 — PRODUCTION persistent privileged recorder daemon.
 *
 * A bare `app_process` entrypoint (shell uid 2000, NO Android Activity) launched DETACHED so it
 * survives Wireless debugging being turned OFF (proven by the spike's setsid-detach technique). It
 * exposes an [IRecorderService] over binder and PUSHES that binder to the app's exported
 * [RecorderBinderProvider] (authority [RecorderBinderProvider.AUTHORITY]) the same way the Shizuku
 * server pushes its binder to a client app. The app then drives recording over that binder with NO
 * ADB — even while WD is OFF.
 *
 * **This class is only the way in.** What the daemon can actually do lives in [RecorderServiceImpl],
 * which is deliberately host-agnostic so a Shizuku user service can offer exactly the same recorder
 * without a second copy of it (`docs/dev-notes/2026-08-24-shizuku-support-plan.md`).
 *
 * FQCN app_process invokes (its `static void main(String[])`):
 *   `com.baba.callvault.server.RecorderServer`
 *
 * Ported from the proven spike:
 *  • persistserver/BinderDebugDaemon — looper prep, [IRecorderService.Stub] pattern, binder delivery
 *    (extracted to [BinderDelivery]).
 *  • persistserver/AudioCaptureDaemon — scrcpy child + CLIENT LocalSocket + ScrcpyClient → muxer
 *    (extracted to [RecorderSession]).
 *  • Shizuku — RikkaApps/Shizuku — server/.../ShizukuService for the overall command-channel shape.
 *
 * Args (positional): `[apkPath, (optional) authority]`. `apkPath` is the daemon's own APK
 * (`applicationInfo.sourceDir`), used to self-extract scrcpy ([ScrcpyJarExtractor]).
