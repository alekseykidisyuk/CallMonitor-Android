/**
 * What CallVault does when a call starts — the whole decision, in one place and free of Android.
 *
 * Both kinds of call have the same three states, and until now each was missing a different one:
 *
 * |               | Off                   | Ask me                   | Automatic            |
 * |---------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
 * | Phone calls   | *was missing*         | auto-record off          | auto-record on       |
 * | App calls     | VoIP recording off    | *was missing*            | VoIP recording on    |
 *
 * The phone-call gap was the surprising one. Turning both auto-record switches off looks like "don't
 * record my phone calls", but it is the **Ask me** state: CallVault still posts a standby
 * notification with a Record button on every single call. Someone recording only app calls got
 * prompted about every phone call they took, which is what made a real Off state necessary rather
 * than a documentation fix.
 *
 * Kept pure so the matrix can be tested exhaustively without a device: this is the code that decides
 * whether a call is recorded at all, and a mistake in it is silent — you find out afterwards, from
 * the recording that does not exist.

    /**
     * Whether the carrier path should stand aside because an app call owns this one.
     *
     * The carrier pipeline is started by the phone-state broadcast, which fires for app calls too —
     * so on One UI a WhatsApp call had it create a second recording, named from the call log (an
     * unrelated contact) and empty, because the daemon was already busy with the real one. Standing
     * down fixed that.
     *
     * The danger is standing down for a call that is genuinely the carrier's, because then nobody
     * records it and the user finds out afterwards, from the recording that does not exist. That is
     * why [carrierCallUp] is consulted and why it wins over the audio mode: an IMS or Wi-Fi call can
     * itself sit in `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`, which the mode check alone reads as an app call.
     *
     * @param voipEnabled           app-call recording switched on at all. Off means this whole rule
     *                              is inert — the behaviour before app calls existed.
     * @param voipRecording         the app-call path already has this call.
     * @param carrierCallUp         Telecom reports a call from a *managed* ConnectionService, which
     *                              an app call never is. See [VoipTelephonyGate].
     * @param modeIsInCommunication the audio mode says an app call, covering the ~230 ms in which
     *                              telephony fires before the app call has been detected.
