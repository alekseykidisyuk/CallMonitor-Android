/**
 * Keeps the app-call (VoIP) path off a carrier call — and only off a carrier call.
 *
 * [VoipCallDetector] recognises an app call by one signal: the audio mode being
 * `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`. That is a ROM convention rather than a rule: Wi-Fi calling and some VoLTE
 * stacks carry the call over IMS and can present the same way. On such a device the app-call path
 * would treat the user's phone call as an app call — a second recording of a call already being
 * recorded properly, and a plain `MIC` capture contending with the dialer for the microphone. This
 * gate exists to prevent that, and still does.
 *
 * **What changed, and why it had to.** The gate originally asked
 * [TelephonyManager.getCallState], which cannot answer the question. Android documents it as
 * returning "the state of all calls on the device... not only calls in the Telephony stack, but also
 * calls via other ConnectionService implementations" — so an *app* call that registers with Telecom
 * reads as OFFHOOK exactly like a phone call. AOSP's `PhoneStateBroadcaster` confirms it from the
 * other side: it excludes only *external* calls from the phone-state broadcast, and takes care to
 * strip the phone number for self-managed ones, which would be pointless if they never arrived.
 *
 * That is not an OEM deviation, it is the platform contract, and it made this gate refuse to record
 * the very calls the VoIP feature exists for. A WhatsApp call on One UI reports OFFHOOK; a Galaxy
 * S24 FE recorded such calls perfectly on 2026-07-26, nine days before this gate shipped and stopped
 * them.
 *
 * So the question is put to [TelecomManager.isInManagedCall] instead, which counts only calls from a
 * **managed** ConnectionService — the carrier's. Wi-Fi calling and VoLTE are carrier IMS and remain
 * managed, so the case this gate was built for is still covered. An app call is self-managed and is
 * no longer mistaken for a phone call.
