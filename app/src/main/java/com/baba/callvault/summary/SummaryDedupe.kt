/**
 * Removing the same point said twice.
 *
 * Observed on the first real Hebrew summary this app produced: "Decisions" held four items, three of
 * them the same sentence, and "Key points" repeated one line three times. The model pads towards its
 * token budget — and raising that budget, which is what stopped whole runs being lost to truncation,
 * gave it more room to do exactly that.
 *
 * The prompt now asks it not to repeat itself. Small models ignore instructions about counts and
 * repetition, so this is the part that does not ask. Same reasoning as [SummaryCitations].
 *
 * **Near-identical, not identical.** The observed repeats were not byte-equal — one differed by a
 * single mis-transcribed word — so exact matching would have removed none of them.
