 * What the model is actually asked.
 *
 * Two instructions carry the whole feature. **Answer in the language of the call** — a Hebrew
 * conversation summarised into English is not a degraded result, it is a broken one. And **invent
 * nothing** — this is a record of something a real person said, so a fluent fabrication is worse
 * than a clumsy summary and far worse than no summary at all.
 *
 * The instructions are written in English regardless of the transcript's language. Small models
 * follow English instructions more reliably than instructions in the target language, and the
 * language of the *answer* is stated explicitly rather than left to be inferred.
 *
 * Pure and Android-free so the wording is under test rather than under review.
