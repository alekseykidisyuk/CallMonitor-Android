/**
 * Whether opening CallVault should require the device's own unlock.
 *
 * **Why this exists now and did not before.** The app used to hold audio files, which a file manager
 * could see anyway. It now holds a searchable full-text record of every conversation, plus a written
 * summary of what each one decided — a materially different thing to hand someone who picks the phone
 * up unlocked. No user asked for this; the reason is the change in what is behind the door.
 *
 * **The lock is the device's, not ours.** [DEVICE_CREDENTIAL] alongside [BIOMETRIC_WEAK] means the PIN,
 * pattern or password already protecting the phone is what opens the app, with a fingerprint or face as
 * the convenient path to the same decision. CallVault stores no secret of its own, so it has nothing
 * better to check against and no business inventing a second one to forget.
 *
 * 🚨 **The recordings must never become unreachable.** The lock is a door in front of the UI, not
 * encryption: the audio stays where the user put it and remains readable by a file manager and by
 * whatever syncs it. That is deliberate — a lock that could strand somebody's call history would be a
 * worse failure than the exposure it prevents. [isAvailable] exists for the same reason: on a phone
 * with no screen lock at all there is nothing to authenticate against, so the setting refuses to turn
 * on rather than shutting the door with no key.
