/**
 * Keeps a long on-device job alive by making it visible.
 *
 * Transcription and summarisation both run for minutes and hold hundreds of megabytes — a whisper model
 * and, for a summary, a multi-gigabyte language model. As plain `CoroutineWorker`s they ran at
 * **cached-process priority**, which is the first thing Android reclaims under memory pressure. The
 * failure that produces is perfectly circular: the job is killed *because* it is using memory, halfway
 * through, having produced nothing, after the user has waited.
 *
 * A foreground service is the only way to tell Android this work is worth keeping. The cost is that the
 * user must be told too, which is the correct trade rather than a nuisance: their phone is about to get
 * warm and use noticeable battery, and a silent explanation-free slowdown is worse than a notification.
 *
 * The channel is **IMPORTANCE_MIN** — present in the shade, no sound, no vibration, no heads-up.
