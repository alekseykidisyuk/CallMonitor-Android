/**
 * Accumulates decoded PCM-16 as **shorts**, in one buffer, with no staging and no trimming copy.
 *
 * The decoder used to write MediaCodec's output into a `ByteArrayOutputStream`, call `toByteArray()`,
 * and then copy that into a `ShortArray`. For a fifteen-minute call at 48 kHz that is 86.4 MB of
 * audio living in three full-length buffers at overlapping moments — the stream's internal array
 * (grown by doubling, so up to 172.8 MB), the byte copy, and the short array. The peak lands around
 * 220 MB against a 256 MB heap, entirely in service of changing the element type.
 *
 * So: decode straight into shorts, size the buffer from the container's declared duration so it
 * normally never grows, and expose [array] with [size] rather than returning a trimmed copy. The
 * consumer reads [size] elements and ignores the tail.
 *
 * **[array] is the live buffer, not a snapshot.** It is valid only up to [size], and a later [append]
 * may replace it. That is the whole point — a defensive copy here would reintroduce the second
 * full-length allocation this class exists to remove.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: one sink per decode, written by the one thread draining the codec.
