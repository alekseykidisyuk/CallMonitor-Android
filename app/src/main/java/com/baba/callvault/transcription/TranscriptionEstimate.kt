 * How long transcribing a recording will take on *this* phone.

 * The estimate is arithmetic — the call's length times a real-time factor — so there is nothing to
 * compute and nothing to show a progress bar for. What actually decides whether the answer is any good
 * is the factor, and that varies by model and by hardware: the published figures were measured on one
 * device, and a slower phone would be told a number that is wrong by more than double.
 *
 * So every finished run reports what it really cost, and the factor for that model is nudged toward it.
 * The first estimate on a new phone uses the published figure; from the second run onward it is that
 * phone's own measured speed.
