/**
 * Which language one transcription runs in: the language picked for that recording if there was one,
 * and the Settings language otherwise.
 *
 * **Why a choice exists at all.** The language is pinned rather than detected because auto-detect is
 * measurably worse — it writes Hebrew in Latin letters and merges a whole call into one segment. The pin
 * is real from the first launch: [defaultLanguage] seeds it from the phone's own language, and the setup
 * wizard asks outright, so nobody transcribes on auto-detect without having chosen it. But a pin is one
 * answer for every call, and a phone takes calls in more than one language: an English call transcribed
 * under a Hebrew pin comes back unusable. So a per-recording answer is offered, off by default
 * (`AppPreferences.getTranscriptionAskLanguage`), and it is one-shot — picking English for one call does
 * not quietly repin the phone to English.
 *
 * **Why the choice is encoded rather than passed as a nullable string.** It travels through WorkManager
 * input data, where "the user chose auto-detect" and "the user chose nothing" would both arrive as null
 * and the setting would silently win over an explicit choice. [AUTO] is that missing value. Stored
 * settings have the same problem and the same answer — see `AppPreferences.getTranscriptionLanguage`.
