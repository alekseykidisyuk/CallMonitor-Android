     * Deliberately excluded:
     * - [TranscriptState.DONE] — already transcribed.
     * - [TranscriptState.RUNNING] — in flight; offering it again would duplicate the work.
     * - [TranscriptState.FAILED] — a file that cannot be decoded fails identically every time, so a
     *   scheduled run must not retry it nightly forever. Only an explicit tap retries.
     * - No local copy — a Drive-only recording has nothing to decode. Queuing it would fail and then
     *   mark it FAILED, which would also hide it from a later run made after it syncs back down.

     * A worker that is cancelled — or killed outright — cannot be relied on to tidy up after itself:
     * whisper runs inside a blocking native call, so the interruption may never reach the Kotlin that
     * would reset the row. Observed on the OP12: after Stop the row sat on the busy spinner for ever,

     * not have rescued it either.
     *
     * QUEUED is included because a tap marks a row queued before its work is enqueued: if that work
     * never runs, the row would sit on the busy spinner for ever, and this mode's queue skips QUEUED's
     * sibling RUNNING anyway. Deleting is safe even if the work does still run — the worker marks the
     * row again when it starts, and a recording with no row is exactly what [pending] offers.
