/**

 * Idempotent: [apply] reconciles the current prefs with WorkManager using
 * [ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.UPDATE], so it is safe to call from Settings, after boot, or whenever
 * a preference changes. Modelled directly on
 * [com.baba.callvault.system.storage.SyncScheduler] so there is one scheduling idiom in this app
 * rather than two.
 *
 * - MANUAL    -> no periodic work; only [runNow] transcribes anything.
 * - AUTOMATIC -> 24h period, first run at the next HH:mm.
