/**
 * The whisper.cpp models CallVault offers, and nothing else.
 *
 * The spec settled on two tiers after measuring on the OP12: `tiny` and `base` are unusable for
 * Hebrew, and `medium` is dominated by turbo on both quality and speed, so offering them would only
 * invite a bad choice. A third arrived later — see [LARGE_V3_TURBO_Q8_0] — and nothing outside this
 * file may assume how many there are: the catalogue is enumerated with `entries` everywhere,
 * including in the wizard's size note, which used to name two of them by hand.
 *
 * **Every tier here must be multilingual.** All thirteen languages the app offers have to keep a
 * working option, so an English-only build (`*.en`) can never replace a tier, only ever be an
 * addition beside one. Both `large-v3-turbo` quants and `small` are multilingual, which is what
 * makes the choice between them purely one of size, speed and fidelity.
 *
 * Digests and sizes are the published Git-LFS values from the model repository, and the SMALL_Q5_1
 * digest was additionally checked against the exact file that was verified on-device. They are
 * load-bearing: ggml's failure mode on a corrupt model is a crash in native code, so a model is only
 * ever used after its digest matches.
 *
 * @param id            Stable key stored on a transcript, so a re-run with a better model is
 *                      distinguishable from a re-run of the same one.
 * @param fileName      Name on disk and in the download URL.
 * @param url           Direct download URL.
 * @param sha256        Lower-case hex SHA-256 of the complete file.
 * @param sizeBytes     Exact published length, used as the cheap completeness check.
 * @param realTimeFactor Seconds of processing per second of audio — the opening estimate only, which
 *                      `AppPreferences.getTranscriptionRtf` supersedes per model id once this device
 *                      has actually run one. Used to warn honestly about how long a long call takes.
 *
 * The entries are ordered by **download size**, which is what the picker and the wizard's size note
 * both show, and deliberately not by how good they are — the largest is now also the fastest, so any
 * "better goes last" ordering would be describing an axis that no longer runs the same way.

    /**
     * Best tier. The same large-v3-turbo, quantised to 8 bits — **faster than [LARGE_V3_TURBO_Q5_0]
     * despite being 300 MB larger**, which is the opposite of what the sizes suggest.
     *
     * The reason is in ggml, not in the model. Its ARM CPU backend keeps two accelerated paths for
     * matrix multiplication — the repacked GEMM traits in `ggml-cpu/repack.cpp`, and the i8mm
     * `vmmlaq_s32` kernels in `arch/arm/quants.c` — and **Q5_0 and Q5_1 are in neither**. Q8_0 is in
     * both: `repack.cpp` returns `q8_0_4x4_q8_0` on any core with DOTPROD and `q8_0_4x8_q8_0` on one
     * with i8mm. So the two tiers this app shipped were, by coincidence, exactly the two quant types
     * that get the generic scalar path. Enabling the ARM feature variants in the build (2ce45c8)
     * bought summarisation 1.74x and transcription only 1.17x for precisely that reason.
     *
     * Measured 2026-08-26 on the OP9 Pro (SD888 — DOTPROD yes, i8mm **no**, so this is the slower of
     * the two Q8_0 kernels), 6 threads, one real Hebrew call of 295.3 s, same decoded audio:
     *
     * | tier        | whisper | rtf   | peak PSS |
     * |-------------|---------|-------|----------|
     * | small q5_1  | 111.4 s | 0.377 |  716 MB  |
     * | turbo q8_0  | 213.1 s | 0.722 | 1258 MB  |
     * | turbo q5_0  | 421.8 s | 1.429 | 1098 MB  |
     *
     * Read the last two rows twice: the **larger** download is the **faster** tier, by 1.98x. The
     * order was confirmed by running each tier both first-after-idle and immediately after the
     * other, so it is not thermal drift — and q5_0 is the one that suffers from heat, losing 12%
     * (421.8 s to 473.7 s) when it runs second, while q8_0 loses 0.6% (213.1 s to 214.4 s). Doing
     * less work, it throttles less.
     *
     * Accuracy, scored against a known Hebrew paragraph rather than by eye: q8_0 is **never worse**.
     * On clean speech it was better — 7.8% WER against 13.7%, the difference being that q5_0 turned
     * "אם עברת דירה" into the meaningless "עם עבר תדירה" and q8_0 got it right. On the same audio
     * degraded to phone-call band with noise, the two produced character-identical transcripts, as
     * they did on two real calls. So the honest summary is: no regression, an occasional real win,
     * and speed is the reason to prefer it.
     *
     * The costs are real and are the reason this is not simply a free upgrade: 874 MB to download
     * instead of 574 MB, about 240 MB more resident while running, and a model load about 1.5 s
     * slower (one-off per run, against minutes saved). A phone without DOTPROD would get neither
     * path and would pay the size for nothing — but DOTPROD is ARMv8.2, which every device this app
     * supports (minSdk 30, arm64) has.
     *
     * [realTimeFactor] is a **first estimate only** — `AppPreferences.getTranscriptionRtf` replaces
     * it with this device's own measurement after a run, per model id. It is the OP12's 2.16 for
     * q5_0 scaled by the 0.505 ratio measured here, and is deliberately an upper bound: the OP12 has
     * i8mm and so takes the *faster* Q8_0 kernel. Treat it as provisional — the OP12's own two
     * figures do not scale to this device by any single constant, and they predate 2ce45c8. Measure
     * on the OP12 when it is next free.

         * Once 2.x ships, that argument is spent. Any future move of this constant is a breaking
         * change for people who already downloaded a model, and needs the migration.
