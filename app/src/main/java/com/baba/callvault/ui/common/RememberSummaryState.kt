/**
 * What the summary card should show for one recording.
 *
 * Two sources have to agree: the database, which says whether a summary exists and whether the
 * transcript it would be read from is finished, and WorkManager, which says whether one is being
 * written right now. They are combined rather than read separately for the same reason the model
 * download's two halves are — read apart, they contradict each other at exactly the moment they
 * matter, which is when a run finishes.
 */
/**
 * Which of a recording's jobs the card should reflect.
 *
 * **A live job always wins.** Every run for one recording carries the same tag, so after the first
 * rewrite there are several — and taking the last of them picked an arbitrary one. On a rewrite that
 * meant the finished job was chosen while the new one was actually running, so the card went on
 * showing the old summary and "Write it again" looked like it had done nothing. It had not: the
 * phone was at 641% CPU writing the replacement.
 *
 * With nothing live, the most recent finished job is the one that describes the state.

 * the one that actually occurs on a rewrite: work appended to an existing unique-work chain starts
 * **BLOCKED**, waiting on its predecessors. So a second summary was correctly queued, correctly
 * tagged, correctly found — and then read as "nothing is happening", leaving the card showing the
