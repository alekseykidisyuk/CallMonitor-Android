 * What the Home pill is saying about transcription right now.
 *
 * Transcription is deliberately silent — no notification, nothing asked of the user — but an overnight
 * backlog is hours of sustained CPU, and a phone that runs warm with nothing on screen to explain it
 * is not acceptable. So: invisible when idle, and a small pill while working.
 *
 * The choice between the forms is a pure function because every wrong answer here still *renders*:
 * "0/0" before the worker has said anything, a stuck-looking "1/1" for a single tapped recording, or
 * a pill left on screen for ever because a finished worker keeps its last progress.
