/**
 * What stands in for the app while it is locked.
 *
 * **It shows nothing about any call** — no contact, no count, not the most recent recording. A lock
 * screen that says "12 recordings, most recently Dana" has already given away most of what the lock
 * was for, to exactly the person it was meant to stop.
 *
 * The button matters more than it looks. The biometric prompt can be dismissed with a tap outside it,
 * and without a way to ask again the only route back in would be to force-stop the app.
