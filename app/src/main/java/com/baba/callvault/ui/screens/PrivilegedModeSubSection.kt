/**
 * Where CallVault's privileges come from, and whether that source is working right now.
 *
 * Shown to everyone, but written for the person who has Shizuku: standalone is the default and needs no
 * explanation here — its readiness is what the setup wizard is about. What this adds is an honest
 * answer to "is the other way available, and is it working?", which is otherwise invisible.
 *
 * The status is read on each recomposition rather than observed: Shizuku's server can stop at any time
 * (it does not survive a reboot), and a cached "ready" would be a lie the moment it did.
