 *
 * Pure logic, no Android and no state, so it can be unit tested directly — [AppLogger] only supplies
 * the per-install salt and calls [redact] on every write.
 *
 * Two kinds of personal data reach the log:
 *
 * 1. **Phone numbers**, which are simply removed. They are worthless for reading a log anyway.
 * 2. **Contact names**, which arrive constantly and were not redacted at all until now, because a
 *    recording's `displayName` *is* its filename and the filename carries the contact:
 *    `20260825_130207.420+0300_out_Some Person.ogg`. Dozens of log sites interpolate that name
 *    ("Transcribed $displayName", "Could not draw $displayName", …), so redacting at the call sites
 *    was never going to hold — the next person to log a display name would reintroduce the leak.
 *    They are **pseudonymised** rather than removed: the name becomes a short stable token, so the
 *    same contact reads as the same token on every line, in every recording, and across separate
 *    reports from the same user — which is exactly the correlation a bug report needs — while the
 *    name itself never leaves the device.
