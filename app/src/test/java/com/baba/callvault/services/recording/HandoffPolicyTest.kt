/**
 * Whether a recording may use the resilient (handoff) path.
 *
 * **Measured on a OnePlus 9 Pro, 2026-08-24.** A Shizuku-hosted process cannot record:
 *
 * ```
 * Direct capture unavailable, falling back to scrcpy: AudioRecord failed to enter RECORDING state
 * ```
 *
 * The daemon's own `startWithFallback` survives that by falling back to scrcpy — but the **handoff**
 * path cannot, because the whole point of it is that the *daemon* creates the `AudioRecord` and hands
 * the live capture to the app. A record that never reaches RECORDING state produces no frames, so the
 * app encodes nothing and writes a **0-byte file while reporting success** — which is exactly what a
 * real call on that phone produced.
 *
 * ShizuCallRecorder, which has run on Shizuku far longer than we have, only ever captures through
 * scrcpy. This is the same conclusion arrived at independently.
