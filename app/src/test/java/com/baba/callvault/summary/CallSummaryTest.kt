/**
 * The parser's job is to be the one place a model's output stops being text and starts being data.
 *
 * Everything here is about refusing to store half a summary. The grammar makes malformed JSON
 * unsampleable, but the grammar is only applied when a model is running under it — a summary read
 * back from an older row, or produced by a run where the grammar failed to compile, must not reach
 * the screen as a half-populated card.
