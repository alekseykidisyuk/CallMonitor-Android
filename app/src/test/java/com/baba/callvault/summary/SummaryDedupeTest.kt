/**
 * Removing the same point said twice.
 *
 * Observed on the first real Hebrew summary this app produced: "Decisions" held four items, three of
 * them the same sentence, and "Key points" repeated one line three times. The model pads towards its
 * token budget, and raising that budget — which is what stopped runs being lost to truncation — gave
 * it more room to do so.
 *
 * The prompt now asks it not to. That is a request, and small models ignore requests about counts;
 * this is the part that does not. Same reasoning as the timestamp check.
 *
 * **Near-identical, not identical.** The repeats were not byte-equal — one differed by a single
 * mis-transcribed word. Exact matching would have removed none of them.
