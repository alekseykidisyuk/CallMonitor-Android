/**
 * What a log line may and may not carry once it is safe to paste into a public GitHub issue.
 *
 * The debug report is built to be attached to an issue, and a recording's `displayName` *is* its
 * filename — so every "Transcribed $displayName" line used to publish a contact's name. These tests
 * pin the replacement down on both sides: the name never survives, and everything that is *not* a
 * name (timestamp, direction, the app a VoIP call was made in) does, because a report with no way to
 * tell two calls apart is not worth collecting.
