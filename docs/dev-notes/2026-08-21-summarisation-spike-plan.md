# On-device call summarisation — spike plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development to
> implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Decide whether a small local LLM can write useful summaries of CallVault transcripts —
in Hebrew as well as English — at a cost a phone can pay, and if so, which model.

**Architecture:** Vendor llama.cpp beside the existing whisper.cpp submodule, sharing one copy of
ggml. A thin JNI bridge mirrors `whispercv.cpp`. Summarisation is map-reduce over transcript
segments: summarise chunks, then summarise the summaries. Everything in this spike sits behind a
debug-only entry point; no user-facing UI is built.

**Tech Stack:** llama.cpp (ggml-org, same org as whisper.cpp), GGUF Q4 weights downloaded at
runtime, Kotlin + JNI, Robolectric for the pure logic, an instrumented test as the measurement
harness.

**Spec:** this document. Background: `docs/dev-notes/2026-08-16-on-device-transcription-design.md`
for the pipeline this would eventually join.

## Why not the platform's own AI

Checked against Google's live documentation on 2026-08-21 (page last updated 2026-08-11), so this is
current rather than remembered.

**There is no API to ask the phone's assistant to summarise text.** Assistant integration runs the
other way — App Actions let the assistant invoke *your* app. The only route out is a share intent,
which hands the transcript to the Gemini app, processes it in the cloud, and returns nothing.

**ML Kit's GenAI Summarization API** is the real system-AI path, and it genuinely runs on-device via
Gemini Nano through AICore. It is still the wrong tool here, for five independent reasons:

| Finding | Consequence for CallVault |
|---|---|
| Supports **English, Japanese and Korean** only | Fails 11 of the 14 languages we offer, including Hebrew, Arabic, Vietnamese, Polish and Russian |
| Input capped at **4000 tokens** (~3000 words) | A 20-minute call already exceeds it; the docs' own advice is to truncate or segment |
| Output is **one to three bullets** | Not a summary of a long call so much as a headline |
| Requires the proprietary **AICore** app | F-Droid cannot build or ship it, and F-Droid is the distribution plan |
| **Not supported on devices with an unlocked bootloader** | Disproportionately our users, who already run ADB tooling |

Also beta, with no SLA and explicit permission to break compatibility.

The privacy notice question therefore resolves cleanly: the on-device path needs no notice but does
not work, and the cloud path would need a very loud one *and* contradicts why people install this
app. If a cloud option is ever wanted, the defensible shape is bring-your-own-API-key, default off,
consent per use — an escape hatch, never the engine.

## Candidate models

Verified on Hugging Face on 2026-08-21. All three have GGUF builds from the major quantisers, which
is itself the evidence that llama.cpp supports the architecture.

| Model | Size | Licence | Why it is a candidate | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **google/gemma-4-E2B-it** (QAT mobile) | ~2B effective | Gemma Terms of Use | Purpose-built for phones; quantisation-aware training gives better int4 quality than post-hoc quantising. GGUF: `bartowski/google_gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF` | Custom licence with use restrictions, not OSI-free |
| **Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B** | 4B | **Apache-2.0** | Claims **201 languages and dialects**. Hybrid Gated-DeltaNet attention, so long context is cheaper — which is exactly our problem shape. GGUF: `unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF` | Newer architecture; multimodal weights we do not need |
| **Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507** | 4B | **Apache-2.0** | Conservative baseline: text-only, mature, the most-tested GGUF ecosystem of the three | Older; weaker multilingual than 3.5 |

Rejected during research: **CohereLabs/tiny-aya** (3B, explicitly multilingual) is **gated** behind a
click-through licence and personal-data form, so `ModelDownloadWorker` cannot fetch it without
credentials. Attractive on paper, unusable in an app that downloads its own models.

On the Gemma licence: we ship no weights, only a downloader — the same relationship we already have
with the whisper models. The app's own GPLv3 is unaffected. Worth a conscious decision anyway, since
an Apache-2.0 alternative exists.

## Global Constraints

Copied from the existing native build and the project's standing rules. Every task inherits these.

- **arm64-v8a only**, matching the app's existing `abiFilters`.
- **`GGML_OPENMP` must stay `OFF`** — the NDK ships no OpenMP runtime and the link fails with it on.
- **`-O3` in Debug builds.** The NDK's Debug default is `-O0`, which for ggml is ~13× slower, not a
  mild slowdown. `add_compile_options($<$<CONFIG:Debug>:-O3>)` already exists and must cover the new
  targets too.
- **Exactly one ggml in the build.** whisper.cpp and llama.cpp each vendor their own; adding both
  naively makes CMake fail on duplicate `ggml` targets. See Task 1.
- **Pin the submodule to a tag**, as `third_party/whisper.cpp` is.
- **No call content ever leaves the device or enters the repo.** The measurement report holds
  timings and ratings only — never transcript or summary text. Transcript text is read on the phone
  by the maintainer.
- **Weights are downloaded at runtime, never bundled.**
- Branch `spike/summarisation`, **local only, never pushed**.
- No `Co-Authored-By` or Claude attribution trailers on any commit.

## What this spike is explicitly NOT

No UI, no Settings entry, no WorkManager job, no database column, no model-picker. Those come after
the decision, and only if the answer is yes. The one deliverable is a filled-in results table and a
recommendation.

## Progress

- **Task 1 — done** (`493c942`). See the correction below.
- **Task 2 — done** (`5165b54`). Three tests pass on the OP12.
- **Task 3 — done** (`0c2e390`). 503 unit tests green.
- **Task 4 — not started.** Needs several GB of model downloads.
- **Task 5 — not started.** Needs sustained time on the phone.

### Correction: the plan was wrong about ggml, in both directions

The plan said to set `LLAMA_USE_SYSTEM_GGML`. **Don't** — that makes llama.cpp look for an
*installed* system libggml, which does not exist here. Both projects already guard their ggml with
`if (NOT TARGET ggml)`, so whichever is added first creates the target and the second reuses it. No
switch, no duplicate-target failure, and the APK carries one libggml.

What the plan under-estimated is the cost. whisper.cpp was pinned to **v1.7.4, January 2025** —
nineteen months stale, from before `gguf.h` was split out of `ggml.h`. Today's llama.cpp would not
compile against it: `fatal error: 'gguf.h' file not found`. Sharing a ggml means the submodules must
be contemporaries, so **whisper moved to v1.9.3** (released 2026-08-20). Pinning llama.cpp back to
January 2025 instead was never an option — that predates every architecture worth summarising with.

**Therefore: bumping whisper is load-bearing, not housekeeping.** It carries nineteen months of
upstream change into the shipped transcription engine. It builds and the suite is green, but
**transcription has not been re-verified on a device**, and that gates anything past this spike.

### Outstanding before Task 4

- [ ] Transcribe a short recording on the OP12 and confirm the text is still right after the
      whisper v1.7.4 → v1.9.3 bump.

## Task 1: Build llama.cpp beside whisper.cpp

**Files:**
- Create: `third_party/llama.cpp` (submodule)
- Modify: `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`
- Modify: `.gitmodules`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: a linkable CMake target `llama`, and one `ggml` shared by both engines.

The whole risk of this task is the duplicate ggml. whisper.cpp does `add_subdirectory(ggml)` and so
does llama.cpp; adding both gives `add_library cannot create target "ggml" because another target
with the same name already exists`. Both projects expose a switch to use an existing ggml instead of
vendoring their own, which is the route to take.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the submodule, pinned to a tag**

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git third_party/llama.cpp
cd third_party/llama.cpp
git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -5      # pick the newest stable tag
git checkout <tag>
cd -
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm which ggml switch each project offers**

```bash
grep -rn "USE_SYSTEM_GGML\|GGML_HOME\|if(NOT TARGET ggml)" third_party/whisper.cpp/CMakeLists.txt third_party/llama.cpp/CMakeLists.txt
```

Expected: both have a `*_USE_SYSTEM_GGML` option. If they do not, fall back to guarding the second
`add_subdirectory` and letting whisper's ggml serve both — record whichever you used in a comment.

- [ ] **Step 3: Wire it into CMakeLists.txt**

Append after the existing whisper block, keeping the existing flags in force:

```cmake
# --- On-device summarisation (llama.cpp) ---
#
# Same org and same ggml as whisper.cpp above. The subtlety is that BOTH projects vendor ggml, and
# two add_subdirectory calls would collide on the target name. whisper.cpp is added first, so its
# ggml is the one that exists; llama.cpp is told to use it rather than build a second.
set(LLAMA_ROOT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../third_party/llama.cpp)

set(LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS    OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(LLAMA_BUILD_EXAMPLES OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(LLAMA_BUILD_SERVER   OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(LLAMA_USE_SYSTEM_GGML ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)

add_subdirectory(${LLAMA_ROOT} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/llama.cpp)

add_library(llamacv SHARED llamacv.cpp)
target_link_libraries(llamacv llama ${log-lib})
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Create a stub llamacv.cpp so the target links**

```cpp
#include <jni.h>
#include "llama.h"

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_com_baba_callvault_summary_LlamaNative_systemInfo(JNIEnv *env, jobject) {
    return env->NewStringUTF(llama_print_system_info());
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and confirm both libraries exist**

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
unzip -l app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk | grep -E "libwhispercv|libllamacv|libggml"
```

Expected: `libwhispercv.so` and `libllamacv.so` both present. Expected APK growth: a few MB.
If `libggml.so` appears twice, or the build fails on a duplicate target, Step 3 is wrong — fix it
here rather than working around it later.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add .gitmodules third_party/llama.cpp app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt app/src/main/cpp/llamacv.cpp
git commit -m "build: llama.cpp beside whisper.cpp, sharing one ggml"
```

---

## Task 2: The JNI bridge

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/src/main/cpp/llamacv.cpp`
- Create: `app/src/main/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/LlamaNative.kt`
- Create: `app/src/main/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryEngine.kt`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `llama` target from Task 1.
- Produces: `SummaryEngine.generate(modelPath: String, prompt: String, maxTokens: Int): String`
  and `SummaryEngine.requestAbort()`.

Mirror `WhisperNative` exactly, including the two hard-won details: one context is not thread-safe,
so a single owner serialises access; and a long blocking native call needs a real abort flag,
because neither coroutine cancellation nor WorkManager can interrupt it. That lesson cost a full
debugging session on the transcription side — do not relearn it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the native side**

```cpp
#include <jni.h>
#include <atomic>
#include <string>
#include "llama.h"

static std::atomic<bool> g_abort{false};

extern "C" JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_com_baba_callvault_summary_LlamaNative_requestAbort(JNIEnv *, jobject) {
    g_abort.store(true, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL
Java_com_baba_callvault_summary_LlamaNative_initContext(JNIEnv *env, jobject, jstring path) {
    const char *p = env->GetStringUTFChars(path, nullptr);
    llama_model_params mp = llama_model_default_params();
    llama_model *model = llama_model_load_from_file(p, mp);
    env->ReleaseStringUTFChars(path, p);
    return reinterpret_cast<jlong>(model);
}
```

Generation loop: tokenise the prompt, decode, sample greedily, stop on EOS, on `maxTokens`, or when
`g_abort` is set. Clear `g_abort` at the *start* of every generate, so a stale abort cannot kill the
following run. Consult `third_party/llama.cpp/examples/simple/` for the current API shape rather
than copying an older sampling API from memory.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the Kotlin surface**

```kotlin
object LlamaNative {
    init { System.loadLibrary("llamacv") }
    external fun systemInfo(): String
    external fun initContext(modelPath: String): Long
    external fun freeContext(ptr: Long)
    external fun generate(ptr: Long, prompt: String, maxTokens: Int, threads: Int): String
    external fun requestAbort()
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Instrumented smoke test — the library loads**

```kotlin
@Test fun nativeLibraryLoads() {
    assertTrue(LlamaNative.systemInfo().isNotEmpty())
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it**

```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PisolateTestApp \
  --tests "*SummaryNativeTest*"
```

`-PisolateTestApp` is not optional: it installs beside the daily-driver build instead of replacing
it, which would drop `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` and break recording.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "feat(summary): JNI bridge to llama.cpp, with a real abort"
```

---

## Task 3: Chunking and prompt, as pure logic

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/main/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryChunking.kt`
- Create: `app/src/main/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryPrompt.kt`
- Test: `app/src/test/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryChunkingTest.kt`
- Test: `app/src/test/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryPromptTest.kt`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `TranscriptSegmentEntry` from `data/transcripts/db`.
- Produces: `SummaryChunking.chunk(segments, maxChars): List<List<TranscriptSegmentEntry>>` and
  `SummaryPrompt.forChunk(segments, language)` / `SummaryPrompt.forMerge(summaries, language)`.

Compose-free and Android-free, like `RecordingSelection` — this is the part that decides what the
model is asked, and it must be testable without a phone.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing chunking tests**

```kotlin
@Test fun `keeps a short transcript in one chunk`() {
    val chunks = SummaryChunking.chunk(segments(10, chars = 50), maxChars = 4000)
    assertEquals(1, chunks.size)
}

@Test fun `never splits a segment across chunks`() {
    val input = segments(100, chars = 200)
    val chunks = SummaryChunking.chunk(input, maxChars = 1000)
    assertEquals(input, chunks.flatten())
}

@Test fun `keeps every chunk under the limit`() {
    val chunks = SummaryChunking.chunk(segments(100, chars = 200), maxChars = 1000)
    assertTrue(chunks.all { c -> c.sumOf { it.text.length } <= 1000 })
}

@Test fun `emits nothing for an empty transcript`() {
    assertTrue(SummaryChunking.chunk(emptyList(), maxChars = 4000).isEmpty())
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them and watch them fail**

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*SummaryChunkingTest*"
```
Expected: FAIL, unresolved reference `SummaryChunking`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement chunking**

Accumulate segments until adding the next would exceed `maxChars`; start a new chunk. Chars rather
than tokens deliberately: a real tokeniser lives on the far side of JNI, and characters are a stable
over-estimate across the scripts we support. Note in a comment that Hebrew and Arabic are denser per
character than English, so the limit is conservative for them.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing prompt tests**

```kotlin
@Test fun `asks for the summary in the transcript's own language`() {
    val prompt = SummaryPrompt.forChunk(segments(3), language = "he")
    assertTrue(prompt.contains("Hebrew"))
}

@Test fun `tells the model not to invent`() {
    assertTrue(SummaryPrompt.forChunk(segments(3), language = "en").contains("only what is said"))
}

@Test fun `carries the speaker when the transcript has one`() {
    val prompt = SummaryPrompt.forChunk(listOf(segment(text = "hi", speaker = "Caller")), "en")
    assertTrue(prompt.contains("Caller: hi"))
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run, watch fail, implement**

Two prompts. Per chunk: summarise this part of a phone call. For the merge: combine these partial
summaries into one, without repeating. Both must state the output language explicitly by name, and
both must forbid invention — a summary that invents a fact about a private call is worse than no
summary at all, which is the single quality bar this feature has to clear.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the whole suite and commit**

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
git commit -am "feat(summary): chunking and prompts, as tested pure logic"
```

---

## Task 4: The measurement harness

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/androidTest/java/com/baba/callvault/summary/SummaryBenchmark.kt`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SummaryEngine`, `SummaryChunking`, `SummaryPrompt`, and transcripts already in
  `transcripts.db` on the device.

The harness is the deliverable of the spike, so it must record numbers rather than impressions.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write it**

For each model file found in the device's model directory, and each transcript named in a parameter,
record: model name, transcript language, transcript length in characters, chunk count, model load
ms, generate ms per chunk, total ms, tokens generated, peak RSS (read from
`Debug.getMemoryInfo()`), and the generated summary.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the report where the maintainer can read it, and nowhere else**

```kotlin
// Summaries and transcript text stay on the phone. This lands in the app's own external files
// directory so it can be read over adb and deleted, and it is NEVER copied into the repo — the
// numbers are what the plan needs; the words are a private phone call.
val out = File(context.getExternalFilesDir(null), "summary-benchmark.txt")
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Push the candidate models to the device**

```bash
adb -s <serial> push gemma-4-E2B-it-Q4_K_M.gguf   /sdcard/Download/
adb -s <serial> push Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf       /sdcard/Download/
adb -s <serial> push Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M.gguf /sdcard/Download/
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git commit -am "test(summary): on-device benchmark harness"
```

---

## Task 5: Run it, and decide

**Files:**
- Modify: this document — fill in the results table below.

- [ ] **Step 1: Ask before running.** The phone is a daily driver, and this pins several cores for
      minutes. Confirm it is connected, charging, and not on a call.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the benchmark over at least four transcripts** — two Hebrew, two English, with
      at least one over ten minutes.

```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PisolateTestApp --tests "*SummaryBenchmark*"
adb -s <serial> shell cat /sdcard/Android/data/com.baba.callvault/files/summary-benchmark.txt
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Read the summaries on the phone and rate each run** 1–5 for faithfulness (did it
      invent anything?) and pass/fail for language (did a Hebrew call come back in Hebrew?).

- [ ] **Step 4: Fill in the table**

| Model | Language | Transcript | Chunks | Load | Total | Peak RSS | Faithful | Right language |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | |

- [ ] **Step 5: Decide against the gate below, and write the verdict at the end of this document.**

## Results

### Qwen3.5-4B, Q4_K_M — measured 2026-08-21 on the OP12

Four runs: an invented Hebrew call and an English one, each summarised whole and again split into
two chunks so the merge path was exercised rather than assumed. Six threads, CPU only.

| Sample | Chunks | Load | Total | Peak PSS | In the right language? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hebrew, 476 chars | 1 | 2461 ms | **43.1 s** | 2907 MB | yes |
| Hebrew, 476 chars | 2 + merge | 732 ms | **213.4 s** | 2903 MB | — no summary reached |
| English, 596 chars | 1 | 1120 ms | **66.1 s** | 2821 MB | — no summary reached |
| English, 596 chars | 2 + merge | 1086 ms | **204.7 s** | 2907 MB | — no summary reached |

**Verdict: fails the gate, on three counts of five.**

- **Speed, by a wide margin.** Those samples are about 500 characters — twenty seconds of talk.
  Forty-three seconds for that is roughly fifty times too slow for the ten-minute call the gate is
  written against. Chunking made it *worse*, not better: two chunks took 213 s, of which the merge
  alone was 94 s. That is the wrong direction for the case the feature exists for.
- **Memory: 2.9 GB** against a 2.5 GB bar.
- **It invented.** The one summary that completed said the delivery window was *"between 9 and 10"*.
  The call said between nine and **eleven**. Fluent, confident, and wrong about the fact a person
  would act on — exactly the failure that makes a summary worse than none.

**It is a reasoning model, which is the wrong tool for this job.** Qwen3.5 thinks out loud in a
`<think>` block first, and on **three of four runs it spent the whole token budget thinking and never
reached a summary**. What came back was its own deliberation, including *"Correction: I need to look
at the actual user input."* That is now stripped before anything reaches a user (`SummaryText`), but
stripping is a bandage: the budget is still spent on reasoning nobody asked for.

The one summary it did produce was, apart from that number, genuinely good — fluent Hebrew, right
speakers, right substance. The capability is there; the cost and the reliability are not.

### What this says about the gate

The 60-second bar assumed summarising is quick next to transcribing. It is not: generation is
serial, and a phone does perhaps eight tokens a second at this size. If a later model is accurate but
slow, the bar worth revisiting is this one — transcription already takes tens of minutes and is
accepted, because it says so up front and runs in the background. **The invention bar is not
negotiable in the same way.**

## Decision gate

Proposed thresholds. A model ships only if it clears all five; adjust before running, not after
seeing the numbers.

| Criterion | Bar | Why this bar |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Summary is in the transcript's language on **every** run | A Hebrew call summarised into English is not a degraded feature, it is a broken one |
| Faithfulness | **No invented facts** in at least 8 of 10 runs, and never an invented name, number or commitment | This is a record of a real conversation; a plausible fabrication is the worst possible output |
| Speed | ≤ **60 s** for a 10-minute call on the OP12 | Comparable to what transcription already costs, so the existing queue, estimate and warning modal fit unchanged |
| Memory | Peak RSS ≤ **2.5 GB**, no OOM with the app in the foreground | Must survive on phones smaller than a 12 GB OP12 |
| Download | ≤ **3 GB** | On top of a whisper model already on the device |

**If nothing clears the gate**, do not ship a worse version of it. The fallback worth costing is
extractive rather than generative — pull the most salient lines straight out of the transcript,
which cannot hallucinate because it invents nothing. Record that as the recommendation and stop.

## Verdict

_Filled in at Task 5._
