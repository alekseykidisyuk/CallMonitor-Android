# Full-system test plan — every feature, flow, pipeline, service and daemon

Written 2026-08-24, on branch `feat/shizuku-support` at the point where Shizuku support is complete and
2.1.0 is waiting on its release gate. The goal is a single sheet that answers "has this been tested, how,
and by whom?" for **everything the app does** — not only the parts that changed.

## How to read it

Every row has a **tier**, which says who can run it and how much it proves:

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **H** | Host — unit tests, lint, build gates. Runs on a laptop with no device. |
| **E** | Emulator — instrumented, `emulator-5554`. Proves binder/transaction/process mechanics. |
| **D** | Device, automated — driven over adb on the OP9 (`daabf34f`). Proves real service and process state. |
| **M** | Maintainer — needs a real two-sided call, a real network, or a reboot with a SIM. Cannot be automated. |

**Status** is one of ✅ pass, ❌ fail, ⏭️ not run, 🚧 blocked, or **M** for a maintainer row that is by
definition outstanding until a real call happens.

The point of the tiers is honesty about coverage. An H row passing means the logic is right; it does not
mean audio comes out of a phone. Only **M** rows prove that, which is why they are listed rather than
quietly folded into "tests pass".

---

## A. Build and static gates (tier H)

| ID | What | How | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Whole unit suite | `testDebugUnitTest` | ✅ 781 tests, 0 failures |
| A2 | Release build compiles | `assembleRelease` | ✅ |
| A3 | Release lint (crash-class only) | `lintVitalRelease` | ✅ |
| A4 | Every locale has every string | `checkTranslations` | ✅ |
| A5 | Release APK is **not** debuggable | manifest check on the built APK | ✅ no debuggable attr; installed pkgFlags clean |
| A6 | Version is bumped for the release | `ciVersionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` | ✅ 2.1.0 |

## B. Privileged transport — the mode machinery

The class of bug that cost a full day: two recorder hosts alive at once. Each row is one of the five
rules in `only-one-recorder-host`.

| ID | What | Tier | How | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Standalone → Shizuku leaves **exactly one** recorder | D | switch, then `ps`/`pgrep` both patterns | ✅ 1 recorder, host=shizuku |
| B2 | Shizuku → standalone leaves **exactly one** recorder | D | as above | ✅ **after the fix below** |
| B3 | The switch waits for the old binder to actually die | H+D | unit + log ordering | ✅ teardown 105 ms (was a 5 s timeout) |
| B4 | `onBinderDied` does not clear a **live** holder | H | unit | ✅ kept the live daemon when the old binder died |
| B5 | `killStaleRecorders` never kills itself | H+E | unit + round-trip still connected after | ✅ `Clearing N other recorder process(es) (I am X)` |
| B6 | Entering Shizuku drops the old user service first | D | log line + fresh pid | ✅ fresh pid each entry |
| B7 | No CallVault service runs in the mode that does not own the recorder | D | `dumpsys activity services` | ✅ no services in the non-owning mode |
| B8 | `DaemonKeepAliveService` is stopped on entering Shizuku | D | dumpsys + log | ✅ |
| B9 | …and does not start on app launch in Shizuku mode | D | force-stop, launch, dumpsys | ✅ logs the standdown on every launch |
| B10 | Wireless debugging is left alone in Shizuku mode | D | `settings get global adb_wifi_enabled` | ✅ adb_wifi_enabled stayed 0 |
| B11 | Every daemon start goes through `RecorderBackend` | H | grep gate: no direct launcher calls | ✅ grep gate clean |
| B12 | Binder round-trip works over our own daemon | E | `RecorderDaemonRoundTripTest` | ⏭️ not run this pass |
| B13 | Binder round-trip works over Shizuku | D | `RecorderShizukuRoundTripTest` | ⏭️ test written, not executed |
| B14 | A stale user service is torn down on app replace | D | install over, check pid changed | ✅ pid 20440 → 23678 |

## C. Capability gating — greying out and auto-off

| ID | What | Tier | How | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `ModeCapability` maps every capability for both modes | H | unit | ✅ unit |
| C2 | Switching to Shizuku turns **off** what it cannot do | H | `disableWhatModeCannotDo` unit | ✅ unit |
| C3 | Returning to standalone never silently turns anything **on** | H | unit — the asymmetry is the point | ✅ unit |
| C4 | The reconcile also runs on **app start**, not only on a switch | H+D | unit + prefs after launch | ✅ unit + observed on launch |
| C5 | Greyed rows are actually disabled in the UI, not just unset | D | UI dump of Settings in Shizuku mode | ✅ **after the fix below** |
| C6 | Handoff is ruled out under Shizuku | H | `HandoffPolicy` unit | ✅ unit |
| C7 | Setup prerequisites differ correctly per mode | H | `SetupPrerequisitesModeTest` | ✅ unit |

## D. Capture pipelines — the three paths

All three exist and are easy to forget; anything reading captured audio must be in all three.

| ID | What | Tier | How | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Carrier call, standalone, **direct** AudioRecord | M | real call, then check the log names the direct path | **M** |
| D2 | Carrier call, standalone, **handoff** (resilient on) | M | real call — this is the OP12's default path | **M** |
| D3 | Carrier call, **Shizuku** (scrcpy) | M | real call on the OP9 | **M** |
| D4 | Two-sided audio present in D1/D2/D3 | M | **listen** to the file — a lost far side is invisible in logs | **M** |
| D5 | VoIP call, standalone | M | real WhatsApp call | **M** |
| D6 | VoIP arming survives a mode round-trip | M | round-trip, then a real VoIP call | **M** ← raised in priority by the fix |
| D7 | VoIP is not offered under Shizuku | H+D | capability unit + UI | ✅ |
| D8 | A missed VoIP call notifies rather than retries | H | unit — retry is impossible by design | ✅ unit |
| D9 | Speaker turns are produced in standalone | M | real call, check `Stored speaker turns` | **M** |
| D10 | Speaker turns are absent under Shizuku **and the user is told** | D | known gap — nothing surfaces it | ❌ still unsurfaced — open gap |
| D11 | Offline (loopback) recording is standalone-only | H | capability unit | ✅ |
| D12 | The daemon survives a mid-call kill when resilient is on | M | kill the daemon during a real call | **M** |

## E. Services, receivers and the daemon (tier D unless noted)

| ID | Component | What is checked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `CallMonitorService` | starts on a call, stops after, does not linger | **M** |

| E3 | `DaemonKeepAliveService` | runs in standalone only; stopped and never restarted in Shizuku | ✅ standalone only; stopped and stays stopped in Shizuku |
| E4 | `AdbConnectionService` | connects in standalone; inert in Shizuku | ✅ connects in standalone, inert in Shizuku |
| E5 | `AdbPairingService` | pairing flow reachable from onboarding | ⏭️ |

| F7 | `UpdateCheckWorker` | polls GitHub, respects the toggle | D | ⏭️ |
| F8 | `UpdateInstallWorker` | standalone: silent `pm install`; Shizuku: `UNAVAILABLE` → one tap | H+D | ✅ unit |

## G. Post-processing — transcription, summaries, speakers, search

| ID | What | Tier | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Transcription produces segments for a real Hebrew call | M | **M** |
| G2 | Language pinning beats auto-detect | M | **M** |

## I. Regression guards for bugs already fixed

Each of these cost real debugging once; each should now be a test rather than a memory.

## Results — run 2026-08-24, OP9 (`daabf34f`) on 2.1.0

**63 rows executed, 2 real bugs found and fixed, 1 known gap unchanged, 15 rows left for the maintainer.**

Sections A, B, C, E, F, H are green apart from the rows marked ⏭️ (not run) — those need either the
emulator, a reboot, or a screen this pass did not reach. Section D is mostly **M** by construction: no
amount of automation proves that audio came out of a phone.

### Bug 1 — leaving Shizuku mode left its recorder running, and the app kept using it

**The most serious thing found, and it was live on the maintainer's phone at the start of the run.** The
very first process listing showed the phone in standalone mode with a `com.baba.callvault:recorder`
still alive — a Shizuku-hosted recorder in a mode that should not have one.

Reproduced deliberately and traced:

```
17:48:32.906  Leaving Shizuku mode; releasing the user service
17:48:32.911  A previous recorder's binder died; the current one is alive - keeping it
17:48:37.925  The previous recorder is still connected after 5000ms      <- the wait gave up
17:48:37.929  Privileged mode is now STANDALONE
17:48:37.932  Recorder daemon already connected; reusing existing binder <- the SHIZUKU binder
```

30 s later the only recorder on the phone was still the Shizuku one, and the switch dialog had said
**"Ready — using CallVault"**. That claim is not cosmetic: `ModeSwitchResult.Ready` means a live binder,
and a live binder was exactly what it had — the wrong one.

The cost is entirely silent. Capture keeps working, so nothing looks broken, but it goes through scrcpy:
**handoff, VoIP arming and speaker attribution all quietly stop happening**, and the front clip that
v1.4.0 removed comes back. A user who tried Shizuku once and switched back would have a permanently
degraded standalone mode with no symptom to report.

Root cause: `ShizukuBackend.stop(remove = true)` only asks *Shizuku* to destroy the service. On this
phone it did not. The ADB branch of the same `when` had always called `destroy()` on the binder it holds;
the Shizuku branch never did.

Fixed in `RecorderBackend.switchTo`, plus `RecorderConnection.forceClear` so a timed-out teardown drops
the old host's binder instead of carrying it into the new mode. After:

```
18:06:52.847  Leaving Shizuku mode; releasing the user service
18:06:52.873  Daemon binder died; clearing RecorderConnection
18:06:52.952  Previous recorder is gone; starting the STANDALONE backend   (105 ms, not 5 s)
18:06:57.136  Recorder daemon connected on attempt 1; binder available
18:06:57.418  Clearing 1 other recorder process(es)
```

Covered by a new instrumented regression test that asserts the mode switch leaves neither the process
nor the binder behind.

### Bug 2 — offline recording was auto-disabled under Shizuku but stayed tappable

`ModeCapability` has always listed `OFFLINE_RECORDING` as unavailable under Shizuku, and the reconcile
duly turned it off — but the row itself was never greyed, so it could be switched straight back on and
would silently do nothing. Resilient recording and VoIP already used `unavailableReason`; this was the
third row that needed it. The Experimental screen now renders the note twice, once per row.

While checking the other three gated capabilities: `DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE` and `WIRELESS_DEBUGGING_CONTROL`
have **no Settings row at all**, and their preferences have no reader anywhere —
`DaemonKeepAliveService` gates on the privileged mode directly. Nothing to grey, and worth knowing
before someone goes looking for the rows the audit implies exist.

### Bug 3 — a mode round trip was a one-way door (fixed after the run)

Raised by the maintainer reading the first draft of this document, and the sharpest catch of the day.

`disableWhatModeCannotDo` only ever switched things **off**, and nothing ever switched them back. So
turning Shizuku on to look at it, and immediately off again, permanently left resilient recording, VoIP
recording and offline recording disabled — with nothing on screen saying so, because the list of what
changed went only to the log. Recording still worked, so there was no symptom to report; the user just
silently lost the setup they had chosen.

The original one-way design existed to protect a real property: a mode switch must never re-enable
something the *user* had deliberately turned off. That property is kept, because the fix does not
snapshot settings — it records **which switches CallVault itself turned off**, and restores only those.
Anything the user turned off was never recorded, so it is never touched.

Recorded per switch rather than per capability, because VoIP recording and VoIP auto-start share one
capability: restoring the capability wholesale would hand auto-start to someone who only ever wanted the
manual prompt.

Verified on the OP9, reading the actual switch node at each step:

| Step | Resilient recording |
|---|---|
| standalone, turned on by hand | `checked=true enabled=true` |
| → Shizuku | `checked=false enabled=false` |
| → standalone | `checked=true enabled=true` |

```
Turned off (unsupported in SHIZUKU): RESILIENT_RECORDING
Turned back on (supported again in STANDALONE): RESILIENT_RECORDING
```

Eight unit tests cover the round trip, including the cases that make it safe rather than merely
convenient: a switch the user turned off stays off, a restored record is consumed so a later reconcile
cannot resurrect it, a restore in a mode that still cannot do the thing is a no-op that keeps the record,
and a second round trip remembers the newer answer.

### Bug 4 — wireless debugging can be left on indefinitely (found, not fixed)

Noticed as an odd end-state, then reproduced and diagnosed. **Not fixed**, deliberately — see below.

Wireless debugging is enabled and disabled in two different files. `AdbShell` turns it **on** whenever
it needs to (re)establish the embedded ADB connection (`AdbShell.kt:170`), and only
`RecorderServerLauncher` turns it back **off**, on the path where that connection ended in a daemon
launch (`RecorderServerLauncher.kt:233`). So any reconnect that does *not* end in a launch leaves it on,
with nothing left to turn it off.

Measured on the OP9 — the last cycle has no matching disable:

```
19:44:49.843  Wireless debugging disabled (DROP_USB_KEEPS_ADBD; commands flow over binder)
19:45:19.605  Re-enabled Wireless debugging; waiting for adbd to advertise…
19:45:23.402  dumpsys usb printed no screen_unlocked_functions line
              (…nothing further…)
```

and `adb_wifi_enabled` was still `1` three minutes later, with no daemon launch in between. The trigger
here looks like the USB-default-mode check: it runs `dumpsys usb` over the ADB shell, which reconnects,
which enables wireless debugging — and since no launch follows, the disable never runs. That last step is
inferred from the log ordering rather than traced through the code, so treat the *trigger* as probable
and the *asymmetry* as established.

Why it matters: wireless debugging is an open network port. Leaving it on after the thing that needed it
is finished is exactly the exposure that got the off-Wi-Fi loopback work parked.

Why it is not fixed here: this is the WD lifecycle, which is where the Samsung churn loop came from —
disabling WD when it was the last transport killed the daemon and span. The fix is probably to pair the
enable with its own disable in `AdbShell` rather than relying on the launcher, but it needs its own
think and its own device test, and it is unrelated to the mode work this run was about.

## The recording matrix — every flow-affecting setting, both call types, both modes

Derived from the preferences the recording and call services actually read, not from the Settings screen
— so it covers what changes behaviour and nothing that does not. Codec, bit rate, file-name template,
storage target, theme and the transcription settings are all deliberately absent: they change the file
or the UI, never the path the audio takes.

### The axes that matter

| Axis | Values | What it changes | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Privileged mode | standalone / Shizuku | which process captures | `getPrivilegedMode` |
| Resilient recording | on / off | **capture path**: handoff vs direct | `isHandoffPersistEnabled` |
| Offline recording | on / off | **transport**: loopback vs wireless debugging | `isOfflineRecordingEnabled` |
| VoIP recording | on / off | whether app calls record at all | `isVoipRecordingEnabled` |
| VoIP auto-start | on / off | records by itself vs prompts | `isVoipAutoStartEnabled` |
| Carrier recording | on / off | whether phone calls record at all | `isCarrierRecordingEnabled` |
| Auto-record incoming / outgoing | on / off | whether that direction records | `isAutoRecordIncoming/OutgoingEnabled` |
| Ignore rules | on / off | whether recording starts for this caller | `isIgnore*`, `getIgnoredContacts*` |
| Audio source | `voice-call` / `mic-voice-communication` | which capture source | `getAudioSource` |

Under Shizuku the first three are greyed and forced off, so that mode has fewer rows — that is the
point of the greying, and rows Z2 checks it.

### Where each switch lives, and the baseline it starts from

Mapped on the OP9, 2026-08-25, by `spike-tools/crawl.sh`. Worth writing down because two of them are
not where you would look for them.

| Setting | Path |
|---|---|
| Record phone calls | RECORDING ▸ **Phone calls** (accordion) |
| Automatically record incoming / outgoing | RECORDING ▸ **Incoming calls** / **Outgoing calls** (accordions) |
| Ignore anonymous / cross-country / contacts | inside those same two accordions |
| Resilient recording | GENERAL ▸ **Experimental** |
| Offline recording | GENERAL ▸ **Experimental** |
| Record VoIP calls + **Start automatically** | GENERAL ▸ **Experimental** — not under RECORDING |
| USB debugging | GENERAL ▸ **Experimental** |
| Audio source / codec / bit rate | AUDIO CONFIGURATION (pickers, not switches) |

**S1 baseline, set and verified:** mode standalone; record phone calls **on**; auto-record incoming and
outgoing **on**; every ignore rule **off** with "Record all contacts" both directions; resilient
recording **on**; VoIP recording **on** with auto-start **on**; offline recording **off** (it has its own
row, S5); audio source `Voice call`.

Two things the mapping turned up, neither chased:

1. **"Ignore cross-country incoming calls" is greyed out** while the outgoing equivalent is not. There
   may be a good reason — an incoming rule needs a home country the SIM has not supplied — but it is
   asymmetric and undocumented.
2. **Turning VoIP recording on raises a confirmation** ("I understand, turn it on"), so it cannot be
   flipped blind. The driver knows that dialog now; anything else automating it will not.

### How each row is judged

Every row records the same four things:

1. **Result** — is there a file, and is it the expected size (or correctly absent)?
2. **Pipeline** — which path the log names: `Handoff: startHandoff…`, the direct session, scrcpy, or
   `armVoipCapture`.
3. **WD status** — `adb_wifi_enabled` **after** the call settles. It must be `0` in standalone unless
   wireless debugging is adbd's only transport. This is the row that was leaking until yesterday.
4. **Audio** — only where the capture path itself changed. Rows expecting *no* recording need only a
   few seconds of call; rows expecting audio need the near-side clip and a few words from the far side.

`A` in the table below = needs real two-sided audio. `Q` = quick, connect and drop.

### Results as rows are run

**S1 — standalone, resilient on, outgoing cell call. PASS (2026-08-25).**

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | **handoff** — `AudioHandoff drainToPipe` streaming, `HandoffEncoder finished: 20.952s` |
| Speaker turns | produced — `Speaker turns came from the handoff capture` → `Stored speaker turns` |
| Services | `CallSessionManager` saw the state change; `RecordingForegroundService` started and stopped; nothing lingered |
| WD after | **0** — the lease fix holding under a real call |
| File | 72,571 bytes, mono opus, 20.94 s, mean -42.1 dB / max -15.5 dB |
| Audio | **both sides confirmed by ear** |

This is row **D2**, not D1: resilient recording is on, so the call took the handoff path. D1 needs
resilient off, which is S3.

**It took two attempts, and the first failure is the useful part.** The first run recorded 11 seconds of
silence exactly where the near-side clip should have been. During a call, media audio is routed to the
**earpiece**, so the clip played perfectly and the microphone never heard a thing. The harness now
switches the call to speakerphone before playing, and — at the maintainer's suggestion — switches it
back off as soon as the clip ends, because a loudspeaker left on replays the far side into this phone's
own microphone and stops the near side being a clean signal to judge.

Worth remembering for any future audio test: a silent near side has two completely different causes that
look identical in the file — the app failed to capture it, or nothing was ever transmitted. Only the
second one is a harness bug, and the way to tell them apart is to ask whether the far end *heard* it.

**S2 — standalone, everything on, WhatsApp call. PASS, with one thing to watch (2026-08-25).**

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Detection | `VoIP call detected (mode=IN_COMMUNICATION)`, app resolved to uid 10207 on attempt 1 |
| Pipeline | `startVoipRecording codec=opus bitRate=24000` → `VoIP capture started: rate=48000` |
| Far side | `farPartyHeard=true` |
| WD after | **0** |
| File | 83,471 bytes, **mono** opus, 19.64 s, mean **-19.0 dB** / max -3.8 dB |
| Silence spans | none over 1.5 s |

Much louder than the carrier call (-19.0 dB against -42.1 dB), which is worth knowing before judging any
future recording by its level alone: the two paths do not land in the same place.

**The thing to watch:** the log reported `near capture silenced by the platform — re-taking the mic`
**seven times** in nineteen seconds, and the capture summary agreed — `19s, 7 silence-filled chunks`.
This is the platform taking the microphone away from our near-side capture mid-call, exactly the
behaviour that makes VoIP recording fragile. The recovery works — no silence span exceeds 1.5 s, so
each gap is short and the file is continuous — but seven interruptions in nineteen seconds is a high
rate, and on a longer call it is worth knowing whether it stays proportional or gets worse.

*A carrier call in the same session showed none of this, so it is specific to the VoIP path.*

**S3 — standalone, resilient OFF, outgoing cell call. PASS (2026-08-25).**

The row S1 could not cover: with resilient recording off the call takes the **direct AudioRecord** path
instead of the handoff, and the log says so in as many words.

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | `Recording via DIRECT AudioRecord — source=voice-call codec=opus` |
| Capture shape | `captureCh=2 encodeCh=1 rate=48000` — two channels captured, encoded to mono |
| Speaker turns | produced — `Speaker turns came from the daemon capture` |
| Auto-record | `Auto-record is enabled for this outgoing call` |
| WD | disabled during setup (`DROP_USB_KEEPS_ADBD`), **0** after |
| File | 80,376 bytes, mono opus, 23.16 s, mean **-33.7 dB** / max -11.7 dB |

**Speaker attribution works on both capture paths** — S1 logged "came from the handoff capture", this one
"came from the daemon capture". That answers a question the code alone made easy to get wrong.

Levels so far, all the same phone and the same clip, which is worth keeping in one place:

| Row | Path | mean |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | handoff | -42.1 dB |
| S3 | direct | -33.7 dB |
| S2 | VoIP | -19.0 dB |

**S5 — standalone, offline recording ON, outgoing cell call. PASS (2026-08-25).**

The transport row: the daemon is reached over a loopback port instead of wireless debugging.

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Transport | `Connected over loopback tcpip :57780 (works off-WiFi)`, `service.adb.tcp.port=57780` |
| WD | **0 before, during and after** — `Nothing to release after the daemon launch; Wireless debugging is already off` |
| Pipeline | handoff (resilient is back on) — `HandoffEncoder finished: 20.536s` |
| Speaker turns | produced and stored |
| VoIP arming | `VoIP capture policy armed (loopback-render, 48000Hz)` → `armVoipCapture -> true` |
| File | 69,948 bytes, mono opus, 20.52 s, mean **-34.9 dB** / max -11.9 dB |
| Audio | confirmed by ear |

Worth stating plainly because it is the whole point of the mode: **a call recorded correctly with
wireless debugging switched off the entire time**, over a loopback listener that survives being off
Wi-Fi. The lease added yesterday did exactly nothing here, which is right — there was nothing to
release, and it said so rather than toggling anything.

### Standalone

| # | Configuration | Call | Expect | Verify | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Z1 — switch to Shizuku, then a cell call. PASS (2026-08-25), and it took two bug fixes to get here.**

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Host | `shizuku(17449)` — the user service, and the only recorder |
| Pipeline | **scrcpy** — `ScrcpyClient` packets, `ScrcpyAudioMuxer` finalising |
| Speaker turns | **absent**, as predicted: `No speaker turns for this recording (mono capture, or an older daemon)` |
| Channels | **stereo** — standalone produces mono, this does not |
| File | 76,922 bytes, 20.69 s, mean **-23.6 dB**; per channel **L -36.6 dB / R -20.7 dB** |
| Services | none running in Shizuku mode |

Two things worth keeping. **Shizuku's output is stereo where standalone's is mono**, so the per-channel
check only works on this path — on a standalone carrier recording there is nothing to split. And the
"no speaker turns" line names *mono capture* as the reason, which is misleading here: the capture is
stereo, the reason is that the scrcpy path never exposes the raw channels to `SpeakerTurnDetector`.

**The bug this row was written to catch, caught twice.** Switching into Shizuku left the phone being
served by our own ADB daemon — the mirror image of yesterday's teardown bug:

```
11:46:49.893  keep-alive: binder-death signal — relaunching immediately
11:46:49.939  Privileged mode is now SHIZUKU
11:46:50.006  Attempt 1: launching recorder daemon
11:46:50.302  Shizuku started the recorder service
11:46:50.547  Clearing 2 other recorder process(es)      <- our daemon killed Shizuku's
```

The keep-alive relaunches on confirmed binder death, and a mode switch causes exactly that death on
purpose. The death signal beat the mode change by **46 ms**, so every mode-aware guard downstream was
too late. The first fix — stopping the keep-alive before the teardown instead of after — was not enough,
because `stopService` only *asks*: the service lives until `onDestroy`, and the death lands in that
window. What closed it was clearing `RecorderConnection.onDeath` **synchronously** inside `stop()`.

Neither would have been found by a process check. B1/B2 both passed throughout — one recorder was alive
each time. It was the wrong one.

### Mode switching — the rows that need a call, not just a process check

B1/B2 proved a switch leaves exactly one recorder alive. They did **not** prove the next call goes
through the right one, and that is precisely the shape yesterday's bug took: the app sat in standalone
mode, reported "Ready — using CallVault", and recorded through a leftover Shizuku host. Every layer was
happy. Only a real call names the pipeline.

| # | Do this | Then | Must see |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z1** | switch standalone → **Shizuku** | cell call | scrcpy in the log, **no** handoff, **no** speaker turns |
| **Z8** | switch Shizuku → **standalone** | cell call | handoff *or* direct, **never** scrcpy, speaker turns back |
| **Z7** | switch Shizuku → **standalone** | VoIP call | `armVoipCapture` true again |

Z8 is the direct regression test for the teardown fix. A pass means the standalone call after a round
trip really is served by our own daemon; a scrcpy line there would mean the old host survived again.

The switch itself should also be visibly honest each time: the modal names the mode it ended in, the
Home pill agrees, and the capability reconcile turns the right switches off on the way in — and, since
this morning, back on on the way out.

### Shizuku

| # | Configuration | Call | Expect | Verify | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Z1 | everything the mode allows | cell | records via **scrcpy** | scrcpy in log, front clip present, **no** speaker turns | A |
| Z2 | same | VoIP | **no recording** — the mode cannot | no arming; the switch is greyed and off | Q |
| Z3 | carrier recording **off** | cell | not recorded | no file | Q |
| Z4 | auto-record outgoing **off** | cell (out) | not recorded | no file | Q |
| Z5 | audio source `mic-voice-communication` | cell | records | source named in log | A |
| Z6 | everything on | cell (**in**) | records incoming | file present, two-sided | A |
| Z7 | after switching **back** to standalone | VoIP | arming restored | `armVoipCapture` true — the row yesterday's fix touched | A |

### Cost, honestly

**22 rows, of which 9 need real two-sided audio and 13 are quick connect-and-drop.** At roughly 20 s per
audio call and 10 s per quick one, that is about 8 minutes of call time — but the real cost is the
setting changes between rows, and there are 20-odd of those.

Suggested split, so a session ends somewhere useful:

- **Session 1 — the capture paths (S1, S2, S3, S5, S14, Z1, Z7).** Every row where the audio path itself
  differs. These are the ones that can silently produce a one-sided or empty file, which is the failure
  that matters. All need audio.
- **Session 2 — the gates (S7–S13, S15, Z2–Z4).** All quick. They prove that turning something off
  turns off *only* that thing, which is exactly where the mode work could have leaked.
- **Session 3 — incoming (S13, Z6)** needs the OP12 to originate, so it is a different setup.

## The call schedule — which real call settles which row

Four calls settle everything that automation cannot, and the order matters: the mode round trip has to
happen **before** the VoIP call, because that is the thing today's teardown fix changed.

Each call is placed from the OP9 to the OP12 by `spike-tools/callharness.sh`, which plays a ~5 s
near-side clip ("Testing, testing. One. Two. Three. This is OP9.") out of the OP9's speaker so its
microphone transmits a near side. The far side is a person on the OP12. Both then have to be present in
one file — that is D4, and it is the row that logs cannot answer.

### Call 1 — standalone, resilient recording OFF

Exercises the **direct AudioRecord** path, which is what v1.4.0 introduced to kill the front clip.

| Row | What it settles | How it is judged |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | The direct path actually runs | the log names it, not the handoff |
| D4 / I8 | Both sides are in the file | the clip AND the far voice are audible; `mean_volume` near -34 dB, not -73 |
| D9 | Speaker turns are produced | `Stored speaker turns` in the log |
| E1 | `CallMonitorService` starts and stops | `dumpsys activity services` during and after |
| E2 | `RecordingForegroundService` shows and stops cleanly | notification during the call, gone after |
| G3 | A non-Hebrew call transcribes | ← **speak English on this one** and it doubles as the 2.1.0 gate |

### Call 2 — standalone, resilient recording ON

Same phone, one switch different, and a different capture path entirely — this is the one the OP12 uses
by default, so it is not an edge case.

| Row | What it settles |
|---|---|
| D2 | The handoff path runs (`Handoff: startHandoff…` in the log) |
| D4 | Two-sided again — the handoff encoder is a separate writer and has produced 0-byte files before |
| D12 | The daemon is killed **mid-call** from adb; the recording must survive and finish |

### Call 3 — Shizuku mode

| Row | What it settles |
|---|---|
| D3 | Capture goes through scrcpy and produces a file |
| D4 | Two-sided under scrcpy |
| D10 | Speaker turns are absent **and nothing tells the user** — confirms the open gap rather than fixing it |
| — | The front clip returns here; the first word of the clip may be missing, which is expected |

### Call 4 — back to standalone, then a WhatsApp call

**Do the mode switch back to standalone first, then place the VoIP call.** VoIP arming happens on a
daemon binder, and today's fix changed which binder that is after a round trip.

| Row | What it settles |
|---|---|
| D6 | VoIP arming survives a mode round trip — the highest-value row on the list today |
| D5 | VoIP recording works in standalone |
| D4 | Two-sided; VoIP files are stereo, so the per-channel numbers apply here |

### After the calls — no further calls needed

These all run on the recordings the four calls produced:

| Row | What |
|---|---|
| G1 | Hebrew transcription produces segments |
| G2 | The pinned language beats auto-detect |
| G5 | Summaries generate |
| G7 | Search finds a word inside a transcript |
| F1 / F2 | The transcription and summary workers ran |
| H4 | The playback screen opens, the waveform draws, notes persist |

### Not covered by these four, and why

- **G4 (a call over 15 minutes)** — an endurance run; it needs time, not coordination. Do it whenever.
- **E7 / I7 (boot behaviour in both modes)** — needs a reboot, and Shizuku must be restarted by hand
  afterwards.
- **H3 (Drive sync)** — needs an account round trip, unrelated to calls.
- **E5, H9 (pairing and onboarding)** — would mean resetting a working phone.

### What only the maintainer can settle

A real two-sided carrier call in each mode, with the audio **listened to** — a lost far side is invisible
in logs and in the waveform. Plus the two 2.1.0 gate items that were already outstanding: one long call
(>15 min) and one non-Hebrew call.
