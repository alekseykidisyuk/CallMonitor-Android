# Shizuku mode: what works, what cannot, and what is greyed out

A sweep of **every** setting and pipeline against both privileged modes, so the answer to "does X work
under Shizuku?" is written down rather than rediscovered on a lost call.

Evidence is marked: **measured** = observed on a device or emulator; **read** = traced through the code
and not yet exercised; **assumed** = neither, and therefore a job, not a fact.

---

## The two facts everything follows from

1. **A Shizuku-hosted process cannot get an `AudioRecord` into RECORDING state.** *(measured — emulator
   as a failed create, OnePlus 9 Pro as a failed start)* Capture there happens through **scrcpy**, which
   spawns its own process. Anything needing a privileged `AudioRecord` **in the recorder process** is out.
2. **In Shizuku mode there is no embedded ADB connection at all.** Anything that drives adb has nothing
   to talk to.

ShizuCallRecorder — running on Shizuku far longer than we have — captures **only** through scrcpy, which
is the same conclusion reached independently.

## Pipelines

| Pipeline | Standalone | Shizuku | Evidence | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Carrier call recording** | direct AudioRecord | **scrcpy** | measured (real call, 46 KB) | works; quality note below |
| **Resilient recording (handoff)** | ✅ | ❌ | measured — produced a 0-byte file | `HandoffPolicy` rules it out; setting greyed + auto-off |
| **VoIP (app call) recording** | ✅ | ❌ | **measured** — the scrcpy `output` alternative captured silence (−73 dB) on the OP9 | greyed + auto-off |
| **Speaker attribution** | ✅ | ❌ | read — `SpeakerTurnDetector` lives only in `DirectAudioRecorderSession`; the scrcpy path never sees raw channels | *not yet surfaced — see gaps* |
| **Offline recording (loopback adb)** | ✅ | ❌ | read — pure embedded-ADB machinery | auto-off |
| **Wireless-debugging control / USB default mode** | ✅ | n/a | read | auto-off; inert |
| **Daemon keep-alive** | ✅ | n/a | read — Shizuku restarts its own `daemon(true)` service | inert in `start()`; auto-off |
| **Daemon lifecycle after app update** | kill + relaunch | **restart the user service** | measured — a stale service kept a dead APK path and lost scrcpy | version = versionCode, plus explicit teardown on `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` |
| **Boot** | `BootReceiver` → call monitor + warmup | same | read | was skipped entirely (gated on pairing); fixed |
| **App-start warmup** | ✅ | ✅ | read | was skipped (same gate); fixed |
| **Onboarding completion** | pairing | choosing Shizuku | read | was never satisfiable; fixed |
| **Silent in-app update** | `pm install` over adb | ❌ → system installer | read | `UNAVAILABLE` → one-tap install |
| **Privileged grants (appops / roles)** | ✅ | ✅ | measured — `grantAppOp → true` | works in both; ColorOS needs "Disable permission monitoring" |
| **Transcription / summaries** | ✅ | ✅ | read — operates on finished files | untouched |
| **Storage, Drive sync, retention** | ✅ | ✅ | read — file-level | untouched |
| **Call detection, filters, auto-record rules** | ✅ | ✅ | read — telephony only | untouched |
| **Diagnostics / log export** | ✅ | ❌ | read — `SystemLogCollector` runs `logcat -g` over `AdbShell` | **gap, see below** |

## Settings, one by one

**Unaffected by the mode** — recording folder, storage target, Drive folder, sync schedule and time,
retention (all four keys), transcription mode/hour/minute/charging/batch/confirm/model/language/ask,
summary language and requirements, speaker map override + confirmed *(stored fine; nothing new to store
under Shizuku)*, carrier recording master switch, auto-record incoming/outgoing, all four ignore rules
and both contact lists, file-name template, audio codec, audio bitrate, theme, dynamic colour, toasts,
vibration, logging toggle, debug flags, developer-mode unlock, update-check toggle and all update
bookkeeping keys, disclaimer, wizard-completed.

**Greyed out and turned off automatically in Shizuku mode** (`ModeCapability` +
`AppPreferences.disableWhatModeCannotDo`):

| Setting | Capability |
|---|---|
| Resilient recording | `RESILIENT_RECORDING` |
| VoIP recording + VoIP auto-start | `VOIP_RECORDING` |
| Offline recording | `OFFLINE_RECORDING` |
| Keep daemon warm (persistent server) | `DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE` |
| Turn Wireless debugging off when idle | `WIRELESS_DEBUGGING_CONTROL` |

Only ever switched **off**, and only what the mode cannot do — so returning to standalone never silently
re-enables something the user had deliberately turned off.

**Audio source** stays fully offered: under Shizuku every source goes to scrcpy, which is the engine the
list was written for in the first place.

## VoIP under Shizuku: tried Ever-Call-Recorder's approach, measured silence, rolled back

`hari161008/Ever-Call-Recorder` — another fork of the same upstream — advertises VoIP recording over
Shizuku, and reading it showed why ours could not do it: **it uses no `AudioRecord` at all.** For a call
from a messaging app it forces scrcpy's `output` (REMOTE_SUBMIX) source, which runs in scrcpy's own
process, so the "cannot start an AudioRecord under Shizuku" wall never applies.

Their reasoning is sound and matches what this project learned from the other side:

- `playback` (AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration) **hard-excludes** `USAGE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION` at the
  platform level — exactly how calling apps tag call audio — so it records silence however privileged the
  caller is.
- Any **mic-class** source competes with the calling app's own microphone session and Android silences
  one for privacy. CallVault met the same wall when a second voice `AudioRecord` during a carrier
  recording silently dropped the user's own side.
- `output` is a privileged system-mix tap gated on `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` rather than a microphone
  capture, and predates that exclusion.

**It was implemented and tested on the OP9, and it captured nothing.** A real WhatsApp call ran the plan
exactly as designed — `audio_source=output`, scrcpy up, muxer initialised, clean EOF, 27,958 bytes over
17.6 s — and the audio measures **`mean_volume: -73.2 dB`**: digital silence. Not one-sided; empty.

The remaining untested hypothesis was **speakerphone** — `REMOTE_SUBMIX` may only receive the call when
audio routes to the speaker. The maintainer ruled that out as a usable requirement: a call recorder that
only works on speakerphone is not a call recorder. **So the whole path was rolled back** (`VoipCapturePlan`
deleted, the coordinator restored, `VOIP_RECORDING` unavailable under Shizuku again) rather than left in
as a switch that produces silent files.

**Conclusion: VoIP recording is a standalone-mode feature.** It is greyed out and auto-disabled under
Shizuku, which is the honest state — CallVault's own loopback-policy capture is proven two-sided, and it
needs a privileged `AudioRecord` that Shizuku cannot provide.

One thing worth keeping from the attempt: the system-mix plan would have needed **no arming before the
call**, which is the constraint that makes a missed VoIP call unrecoverable in standalone. If a device is
ever found where the submix does carry call audio, that is the prize worth re-opening this for.

## Gaps still open

1. 🔴 **Speaker attribution is silently absent under Shizuku.** A call recorded there has no turns, so its
   transcript cannot be attributed. Nothing tells the user. The transcript sheet should say so rather
   than simply never offering names.
2. 🔴 **Diagnostics/log export needs the ADB shell.** `SystemLogCollector` grows the logcat ring and reads
   it via `AdbShell`, so bug-report export is degraded in Shizuku mode. The user service *can* run
   processes (`PrivilegedGrants` already does), so this is routable — it just has not been routed.
3. 🟡 **Front clip returns.** scrcpy costs the ~1–2 s of audio that direct capture removed in v1.4.0.
   Inherent to the mode; worth stating in the UI beside the greyed-out rows.
4. 🟡 **Cold-start race.** Shizuku's bind is asynchronous (10 s budget). A call arriving seconds after a
   reboot — before the user has started Shizuku — cannot record, and Shizuku must be started by hand on
   every boot. The status card names it; nothing pre-warms it.

## The return path — verified 2026-08-24

Toggling Shizuku back off on the OP9 and placing a real call, read from the device log:

```
15:22:54  Leaving Shizuku mode; releasing the user service
15:22:54  Privileged mode is now STANDALONE
15:23:35  Binder delivery finished ok=true          <- our OWN daemon, our own provider authority
15:23:35  Handoff: calling daemon startHandoff(voice-call, 48000, 2)
15:23:35  Handoff: startHandoff returned true in 93ms
15:23:35  armVoipCapture -> true                    <- VoIP arming restored
15:23:50  Speaker turns came from the handoff capture
15:23:50  Stored speaker turns; this call suggested a_far
```

Everything the mode had taken away came back: our own daemon, the handoff path, VoIP arming, and speaker
attribution. It also confirms the prediction for the mode it left — the Shizuku call twenty minutes
earlier logged `No speaker turns for this recording`.

**And it found a gap.** Resilient recording was still *enabled* through all of this, because
`disableWhatModeCannotDo` ran only on a mode **switch** — and a user already in Shizuku mode when this
shipped never goes through one. Their VoIP and resilient-recording switches would have stayed on while
being unable to work. The reconcile now also runs on **every app start**; it only ever turns things off,
and only what the current mode cannot do, so it is safe to repeat.

## Must be checked before this ships
- [ ] A real VoIP call in **standalone** after a mode round-trip, since arming happens on a daemon binder.
- [ ] Speaker attribution still works in standalone after a round-trip.
- [ ] A reboot in Shizuku mode: start Shizuku, confirm the first call records.
