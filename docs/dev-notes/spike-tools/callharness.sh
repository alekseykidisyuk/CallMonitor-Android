# Two-sided call harness for the OP9.
#
#   ./callharness.sh state              what mode / recorder / call state is the phone in
#   ./callharness.sh call [seconds]     place a call to פרוזה, play the near-side clip, hang up
#   ./callharness.sh collect            pull the newest recording and measure it
#   ./callharness.sh clip               (re)push the near-side clip and set media volume
#
# The near side is a spoken count ("Near side 1, Near side 2 …") played out of the OP9's own
# speaker so its microphone transmits it. The far side is a human on the OP12. Both are then
# identifiable in one file — by ear, and in the transcript CallVault produces itself.
#
# Generate the clip on a Mac with:
#   say -v Daniel -r 165 -o clip.aiff "This is the CallVault near side test. Near side 1. …"
#   ffmpeg -i clip.aiff -ac 1 -ar 44100 -b:a 128k nearside.mp3
#
# Reading the numbers:
#   ~-34 dB mean   a real two-sided carrier call (measured, OP9, 2026-08-24)
#   ~-73 dB mean   digital silence — the file exists, the pipeline reported success, nothing was
#                  captured. This is the failure shape that matters, and it is invisible in logs.
#
# Carrier recordings are MONO, so the per-channel check below only applies to VoIP (stereo). For a
# carrier call, "not silent" is all the numbers can prove: that BOTH sides are present is settled by
# the transcript (English counting AND Hebrew) or by listening.
